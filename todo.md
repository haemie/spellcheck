<h1>TODO:</h1>

- make case insensitive

- handle words with accents like garÃ§onniere

- look into pronounciation helpers:
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/compromise
  https://observablehq.com/@spencermountain/compromise-pronounce
  words like khor

- look into other dictionary apis:
  https://developer.wordnik.com/

- check word from dictionary matches query:
  lustration => lustrate,
  russel => Crouse?

- use own database?

- remove answer word from client state entirely?
